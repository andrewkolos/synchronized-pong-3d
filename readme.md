## Play locally vs the CPU
```
npm i
npm run game-demo
```

Open a browser to localhost:8080.
Move your paddle with WASD and rotate it with Q/E. You can also use a gamepad, using the two control sticks.

## Simulate playing over a high-latency internet connection (unpolished)

```
npm run network-demo
```

Control the other paddle with UHJK.
